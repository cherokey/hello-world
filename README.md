# hello-world
First repository. Getting use to GitHub.

Hey y'all!

Not gonna lie, I am a beginner at all this, even programming in general. Also not good at
introducing myself. I suppose I will start with topics of interest. I am working on learning C++, C#,
and python. I am studying Computer Science with a strong interest in game design, but I will settle
with a career in programming or graphic art. Of course, that wont stop me from creating games on my
free time.

I enjoy creating things, whether it be writng, drawing, pottery, etc. With game design I get to do
just that. i get to mash most of my interests into mssive piece of art. At least, that is what I hope to
accomplish.

Anywho, that is pretty much it.

Safe journeys.
